Using advanced static analysis techniques, the FLARE Obfuscated String Solver (FLOSS, formerly FireEye Labs Obfuscated String Solver) automatically extracts and de-obfuscates all strings from malware programs. Like strings.exe, it can enhance the basic static analysis of unknown binaries. FLOSS also includes more Python scripts in the script's directory, which can be used to load the script's output into other programs like IDA Pro or Binary Ninja.

Command:
floss .\cobaltstrike.exe
