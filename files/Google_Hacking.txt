Google hacking / Dorking utilizes Google's advanced search engine features, which allow you to pick out custom content. You can, for instance, pick out results from a certain domain name using the site: filter, for example (site:tryhackme.com) you can then match this up with certain search terms, say, for example, the word admin (site:tryhackme.com admin) this then would only return results from the tryhackme.com website which contain the word admin in its content. You can combine multiple filters as well.
