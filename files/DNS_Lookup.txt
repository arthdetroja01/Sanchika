nslookup

nslookup is a utility to query DNS servers for information about a domain name.
General Syntax

nslookup [OPTIONS] DOMAIN_NAME [SERVER]

    DOMAIN_NAME: The domain to query.
    OPTIONS: Specifies the query type (e.g., A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, etc.).
    SERVER: DNS server to query (e.g., 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8).

Query Types
Option	Purpose
A	IPv4 addresses
AAAA	IPv6 addresses
CNAME	Canonical names
MX	Mail exchange servers
SOA	Start of Authority
TXT	Text records
Examples

    Query IPv4 addresses:

nslookup -type=A example.com

Query Mail Exchange (MX) records:

nslookup -type=MX example.com

Use a specific DNS server:

    nslookup -type=A example.com 1.1.1.1

dig

dig (Domain Information Groper) is a more advanced DNS query tool.
General Syntax

dig [@SERVER] DOMAIN_NAME [TYPE]

    SERVER: DNS server to query (optional).
    DOMAIN_NAME: The domain to query.
    TYPE: Specifies the record type (e.g., A, MX, TXT, etc.).

Query Types
Type	Purpose
A	IPv4 addresses
AAAA	IPv6 addresses
CNAME	Canonical names
MX	Mail exchange servers
SOA	Start of Authority
TXT	Text records
Examples

    Query IPv4 addresses:

dig example.com A

Query MX records:

dig example.com MX

Use a specific DNS server:

    dig @8.8.8.8 example.com A

Key Points

    nslookup is simple but limited in detail.
    dig provides more information, such as TTL (Time To Live) by default.
